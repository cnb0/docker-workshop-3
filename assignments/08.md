# Bash wrapper scripts

Nice, all those `docker` commands. Really powerful too. But we don't want to keep them al in our head. Create a Bash script called `up.sh` that simply contains all the commands for:

- building the image for the web server
- pulling the image for redis (`docker pull redis:2.3`)
- starting the redis service
- starting the web server

Create another Bash script that contains all the commands for:

- stopping the web server
- stopping the redis service
- removing the web server container
- removing the redis service container

Learn more about Bash from the article [Bash scripting quirks & safety tips](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/03/26/bash-quirks/) by Julia Evans.

The [BASH Programming](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html) website contains lots of interesting material too.

## Hints

- Start the scripts as follows:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    ```
    
- Make the scripts executable. For example: run `chmod u+x ./up.sh` so you can execute it as `./up.sh`
- To make a script fail as soon as any command fails, add: 

    ```bash
    set -e
    ```

By the way, in another workshop we'll take a look at [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which can do a lot of this kind of wrapping for us.
