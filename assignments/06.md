# Building a custom image

Instead of using a "bind-mount volume" to make files from the host available inside the container, we can also copy the files into the container. Take a look at how this build step is defined in `docker/webserver/Dockerfile`.

You can build the container by running:

```bash
docker build -t my_webserver -f docker/webserver/Dockerfile ./
```

This means: tag the image as `my_webserver`, use `docker/webserver/Dockerfile` for build instructions and use the current working directory `./` as the "build context". This means that you can refer to any project file within the given `Dockerfile`.

Now you can start the web server again, this time referring to your own image:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 my_webserver
```

Note that we haven't provided the volume anymore. We don't need it, since `index.php` has been copied to the right location already. The image is completely stand-alone and could be deployed to a production server if we like.

There are lots of other things you can do in a `Dockerfile`. Take a look at the [reference documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).
