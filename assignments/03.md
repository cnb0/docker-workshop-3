# Run a web server

We'll start an Apache web server.

We use the [official `php` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) for it. You can run a specific version of an image by adding for example `:7.1-apache` to the name of the image.

Try running the image. It will start up the web server that listens at port 80. However, currently we can't reach it. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the container. 
 
Look up in the [documentation for `docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) how you can publish container port 80 as port 80 on localhost. When you've figured it out, take a look at `http://localhost/`. It should show something like this:

```
Forbidden

You don't have permission to access / on this server.
Apache/2.4.10 (Debian) Server at localhost Port 80
```

At least it responds!
