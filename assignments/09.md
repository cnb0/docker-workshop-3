# Networks

Instead of linking containers explicitly using `--link` you could make them part of a sub-network, to which only connected containers have access. First, create a new network called "website" (you can add this line to `up.sh`, before the `docker run` commands):

```bash
docker network create website
```

You can add both containers to the same network by providing an extra option: `--network=website`. Update the `up.sh` script to do so.

To test it all, first run `down.sh`, then `up.sh` again and visit `http://localhost/` again.

## Hints

- The second time you run `docker network create website`, the command will fail, and so will the entire script. To prevent this from happening add ` || true` to the line. This will make the command always succeed.
- For symmetry, at the end of `down.sh` you could `docker network rm website`.
