# Managing running containers

It wouldn't be very handy if you'd have to leave open your terminal while the web server was running. Take a look at the [documentation for `docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) how you can run a container in the background.

Once you have the web server running in the background, you can run `docker ps` again to take a closer look. You can find out a lot more about the container by copying the container ID of the web server and feed it as an argument to `docker inspect`.

At some point you want to stop the web server. You can do so by running `docker stop [container ID]`. However, that means you'll have to look up the container ID first, using `docker ps`. Instead, you could provide a memorable name for the container, like `webserver`:

```bash
docker run --name webserver ...
```

If you do so, you can then stop the container by its name, e.g.

```bash
docker stop webserver
```

Stopped containers aren't automatically removed, so you can restart them if you like:

```bash
docker restart webserver
```

If you want to run the `webserver` container again, with different options and arguments, you first have to remove it:

```bash
docker rm webserver
```

Add `-f` if the container is still running (or stop it first).

## Logging

Containers usually log interesting information to `stdout` and `stderr`. You saw some of this already when you ran `docker run`. But if you run containers in the background, you have to explicitly look up the logs, like this:

```bash
docker logs webserver
```

Add `-f` if you want to "follow" the logs (like with `tail -f`).
