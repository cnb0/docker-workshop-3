# Serve PHP files; mount a directory from the host

We'd like to serve the `index.php` file in the `web/` directory.

How to get it inside the container so Apache can find it?

We could simply mount the root directory of the project into the container at the right location, which is `/var/www/html/`.

To mount a directory from the host, we should provide its full path, e.g. `/Users/matthias/Projects/matthiasnoback/docker-workshop/web`, then a colon (`:`), and finally the "target" directory inside the container, e.g. `/var/www/html/`. On Unix systems we can use `pwd` to get the working directory, so we can simply run:

```bash
docker run -v `pwd`/web:/var/www/html ...
```

If we provide the remaining arguments (the port to publish and the image name), we should be able to reload `http://localhost/` and see the following:

```
Hello World!
```

As you may have noticed, this should have been "Hello, World!". Make the change in `web/index.php` and reload the page.
