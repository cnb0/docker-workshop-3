# Run a small Linux distribution

The official [`alpine` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/) contains a small Linux distribution. It is often used to keep distributed images small.

Try running it:

```bash
docker run alpine
```

It doesn't do anything by default. In fact, you have to provide a command. Take a look at the documentation for [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) to find out how you can provide a command. For instance, let's start an interactive shell (`sh`).
 
It still doesn't do anything because it needs:

- a terminal (TTY)
- user input (via STDIN)

Take another look at the documentation for [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) to find out how to run the `sh` command interactively.

If you have succeeded you should see a shell prompt:

```
/ #
```

You should be able to type in a command, like `ls`.

Now try `ps aux`. 

- Which user does the shell command run under?
- Where are all the other processes that run on your machine?
