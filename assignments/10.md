# Share your image with the world

In order to deploy a container image, you should push it to an image registry first. Though you can easily [host one yourself](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry/), let's use the free (but public) Docker Hub image registry for now.
 
First, create an account on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com). Then, login using [`docker login`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/).

Now, you need to re-build (or [re-tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/)) your image and provide a more elaborate tag:

```bash
docker build -t matthiasnoback/my_webserver -f docker/webserver/Dockerfile ./
```

(Where `matthiasnoback` should be replaced with your own Docker Hub username of course.)

Now you can run:

```bash
docker push matthiasnoback/my_webserver
```

By the way, you can be more specific and supply a version number of some sorts, e.g. `matthiasnoback/my_webserver:1.0.0`.

Take a look at your Docker Hub dashboard to find out if the image was pushed successfully.

Now that it is available, you can pull it from the registry too.

First, remove existing copies of your image:

```bash
docker rmi matthiasnoback/my_webserver
```

Now, pull the latest image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull matthiasnoback/my_webserver
```

The image will be downloaded and you can start using it again to run a container based on it.
